News Headlines App
This project is an Android application designed to fetch and display news headlines using the NewsAPI. The app is built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, and it follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture.

Features
Retrieves top news headlines based on specified country and category.
Displays headlines in a user-friendly list format.
Implements a loading state to indicate when news is being fetched.
Logs errors and exceptions for better debugging and handling of API responses.
Architecture
The app uses the MVVM architecture, ensuring a clear separation between data handling (Model), business logic (ViewModel), and UI components (View). This makes the app easier to maintain, test, and extend.
